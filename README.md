This program was created as a simple tool for Product Management Technicians to store basic hospital data. 
An expiration date calendar is the primary purpose, and will allow the user to add and edit new data; 
the calculator stores the minimum number of days a hospital will accept from the current date
and output the minimum expiration date the technician is able to send. 
This program has the ability to ADD, SEARCH, EDIT, DELETE, and VIEW hospital data. 
Hospital data includes hospital code, address, phone number, fax number, and accepted outdate.

It is intended for personal use and does not have any official affiliation with LifeServe Blood Center.
